Computer based medical devices are termed as medical instruments.  Patient monitoring devices refer to the continuous observation of repeating events of physiologic function to guide therapy.  Medical diagnostics refers to discrete testing conducted to provide critical health care information for risk assessment, early diagnosis, treatment or disease management. "/>

Common data models are flat, object oriented, hierarchical, network, relational deductive and semi structured. Interfaces are utilized to process an existing database.  Common sources of input data include mouse, keyboard activity, voice recognition, barcode readers, wireless devices and RF-ID tags. Electronic data recorders, sequencing machines and a variety of test equipment can also provide data for inclusion in the database, according to the device communications standards. Common Gateway Interface (CGI), PHP: Hypertext processor and Java. A user submits a query through a web browser and the server executes a program, a CGI script and the user's query is transferred to the database via CGI. The program returns information to the server via CGI and this information is formatted in an HTML web page which is displayed through the user's browser. Communication models include client - server and peer to peer.  Bioinformatics R&amp;D involves the generation, capture, management and repurposing of vast amounts of data.  Hardware components include the common medial ie. wireless networks or fiber optics. and network electronics.    Major devices for network electronics includes:  Bridge, Hub (star topology), Modem (LAN or internet network), Monitor (monitors activity by network by node and network segment), Router(sends data transmissions only to portion of  a network meant to receive them), Satellite (transmits signals from a server in orbit), Server ( supplies files and applications to clients), Switch (selects network paths at high speeds), UPS ( provides uninterruptible power for network electronics), Wireless Hub ( cable free access to servers, shared resources and the internet), Wireless Modem ( allows workstations and laptops to communicate).
